# ~~Simple~~ IoT Server

A (probably) lightweight IoT server implementation for managing and monitoring smart devices with MQTT support.

This readme only provides some explanation for the codebase that might be uncompleted. Please review the source code carefully to fully understand the architecture and functionality before making any modifications.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Also note that this is not Production ready!
This server are only intended for testing and development. I do not recommend to use this for production, as this may still contains bug and vulnerability hidden in the code.

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.com/template/3Jbbxj?referralCode=4iJO-9)

- There's some important step to look before you deploy. Please check them first. ([here](#hosting))

## ü§î What's This?

This is an IoT server that provides:
- Device authentication and management
- MQTT message broker for device communication  
- Support for master (controller) and agent devices
- Token-based authentication with JWT
- Rate limiting and security features
- Automatic device reconnection handling
- Structured logging system with prefixes
- Database migrations and ORM support
- Deploy-ready configurations (with Railway template) (some configuration might not completely set, check [here](#hosting))

## üõ†Ô∏è Used Services

- **API Server**: [Bun](https://bun.sh) + [Hono](https://hono.dev)
- **MQTT Broker**: [EMQX](https://www.emqx.io)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team)
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens
- **Logging**: Pino with pretty printing
- **Deployment**: [Railway](https://railway.app) (Recommended)

## üíª Hosting

1. Click the "Deploy on Railway" button above
2. Configure the required environment variables:
   - `MQTT_ADMIN_PASSWORD`: EMQX dashboard admin password
   - `DEVICE_MASTER_SECRET_KEY`: Secret for master device registration request
   - `DEVICE_AGENT_SECRET_KEY`: Secret for agent device registration request
   - `DEBUG`: Set to "true" for debug logging (optional)
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important!!** <br>After first time deploy, you must set the EMQX gateway (http) domain in order for Backend be able to access the EMQX API or the **Backend server might crash**.<br><br>Go to the `EMQX` service >> `Settings` >> `Networking` then add domain for API gateway (generate or use custom domain), then **redeploy** the Backend service.

## ‚ôæÔ∏è Arduino Client Lib (ESP8266)

A library for esp8266 is available at `arduino_client/esp8266` folder, including example. Currently it's untested and may contains bug or unexpected error, so be careful!

To use the library, please make sure both `KV` and `SMServer` is imported to your project, and install `PubSubClient` and `ArduinoJson` from Arduino library.

## üåê Endpoints

Both API server and gateway will response a json format.<br>
More example can be see below.

- <a name="end-code"></a> `c`: **Result Code**<br>
This indicate for the response result.<br>
Common possible output: 
  - `OK`: Response success.
  - `FORBIDDEN`: You're unauthenticated or trying to access unallowed resource.
  - `ERROR`: Internal server error occured. (any unhandled exception can caused this, recommend enabling `DEBUG` mode)

- `t`: **Session Token**<br>
Used to authenticate to all other endpoints/mqtt server.<br>
Can be obtained from device registration endpoint.<br>
Possible output: `JWT string`

- `ip`: **MQTT Server IP**<br>
This response is specific for API endpoint `/mqtt` when requesting server ip.<br>
Possible output: `A resolvable IP`

### Authentication

#### Device authentication > API Server
- <a name="endpoints/auth/devices/request"></a> `GET /auth/devices/request?uuid={deviceId}`<br>
Request device registration and token.<br><br>
**Note:** This server **does not check** for uuid device registry, and allows **any valid uuid** with valid secret key to be registered to the database. This is by default for making device registration easier. Be careful!<br><br>
Possible output:<br>
  - Success (device is valid and registered)<br>
  `{"c":"OK","t":"eyJkZXZpY2i...M2n5I"}`
  - Not registered (device is valid but not registered / assigned to an owner. User must send a valid device registration endpoint first in order for device to be added as registered. (endpoint coming soon, please manually add it for now))<br>
  `{"c":"NOT_REGISTERED"}`<br>
  - Forbidden (in most case, you have typos in secret key)<br>
  `{"c":"FORBIDDEN"}`<br>
  - [Error](#end-code)<br>
  `{"c":"ERROR"}`<br><br>

- <a name="endpoints/mqtt" style="margin-top:-20px;"></a> `GET /mqtt`<br>
Get MQTT broker connection details. (token using from the device registration endpoint)<br>
Possible output:<br>
  - Success<br>
  `{"c":"OK","ip":"gateway.rlwy.net:12345"}`
  - Forbidden (invalid/expired session token, please request to device registration endpoint again for new token)<br>
  `{"c":"FORBIDDEN"}`<br>
  - [Error](#end-code)<br>
  `{"c":"ERROR"}`

#### Device authentication > MQTT
This is mostly handled by mqtt client, but you might want to add logic to request new token to device registration endpoint when received `Not authorized` error (this is a message sent by mqtt server when an invalid/expired credentials are passed.)

If you're trying to connect manually, you can use this credentials:
- Username: `device_<uuid>`
- Password: `<token received from device registration endpoint>`

### MQTT Topics

**Master devices**<br>
Master devices can publish/subscribe to:
```yaml
device/{masterUUID}/ping
device/{masterUUID}/data
```
and related agent devices
```yaml
device/{agentUUID}/master
```

**Agent devices**<br>
Agent devices can publish/subscribe to:
```yaml
device/{agentUUID}/ping
device/{agentUUID}/data
device/{agentUUID}/master
```

### MQTT Commands

Currently, it only support `PING` command, but will add more soon.

**Master/Agent devices**

Topic: `/device/{deviceUUID}/ping`
```js
{"c":"PING"}

// Expect response from server: 
{"c":"PONG"}
```
