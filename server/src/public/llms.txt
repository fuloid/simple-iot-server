# Server Context:
- This is a Simple IoT Server (SM-S) for managing smart devices
- Built with Bun + Hono for API and EMQX for MQTT
- Supports master-agent device architecture
- Uses PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for data persistence
- Features structured logging with Pino

# Key Components:
1. Authentication System
   - JWT-based device authentication
   - Basic auth for application access
   - MQTT credentials for device communication

2. Device Types
   - Master: Controller devices that manage agents
   - Agent: Sensor/actuator devices that report to masters

3. Data Structure
   - Sensors: water_temp, water_acidity, water_turbidity, water_level, air_temp, humidity, food_level
   - Actions: food_refill, water_refill, water_drain
   - Device status: online/offline tracking with ping system

4. Communication Patterns
   - REST API: For application interactions
   - MQTT: For device communication
   - Structured logging: For system monitoring

5. Security Features
   - Rate limiting
   - Token-based auth
   - Access control per device type
   - Secure MQTT channels

# Development Notes:
